## Description
This is a timed quize to test knowlged on coding questions. 

## Why
I wanted to create a quize to help study and test my knowldge on what I've learned so far.

## What did I learn 
One thing I learned was how to use settimeout out. This delays a command. This is how a was able to display if the user got a question right or wrong. It did take some time for me to fiqure out how to get this to work. I have the feedback display for a few seconds and then the settime out changes the class back to hide. One area I need to improve on with this quize is the score board. It's not quite how I want it.
